# NLP-Med-Dialogue
Here, I decided to analyze these dialogues and clean them for having them ready for Modeling. Unfortunately, we're not going to do any kinds of modelling here, all that we're going to do is analyse the dataset that we have by cleaning, removing the characters that represent a noise to the data, and adjusting the punctuation so it can help for having factual sentences.
